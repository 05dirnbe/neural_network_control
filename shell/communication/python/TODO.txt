Problems to be addressed in improved versions:

1) move the dependence on write and read commands to the communications module

2) make sure the commander uses the commands from the communications module

3) Figure out how to deal with commands that have a payload

4) Write a class representing the fpga operations

5) Add the fpga class to the controller as member

6) Write a class that encapsulates the serialization needed

7) Add class to the controller
